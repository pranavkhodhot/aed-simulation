AED Plus Software Simulation


## Project Overview

This project involves the design and development of a simulation for the AED Plus (Automated External Defibrillator Plus) system utilizing Qt C++. The AED Plus is a life-saving medical device used in cardiac emergencies, and the goal of this project is to create a simplified software simulation to demonstrate its functionality and allow user interaction.

## Project Team

The project is a collaborative effort of a team consisting of four members:

- Pranav Khodhot (UI, Project Architecture, Documentation, Diagrams)
- Abdul Hadi (UI, Threading, Documentation, Diagrams)
- Daniel Vlassov (UI, State Behaviours, Documentation, Diagrams)
- Miguel Bayer (UI, State Behaviours, Documentation, Diagrams)

Each submission includes all files necessary to build the project, the documentation, and a video demonstration (as well as a link here in case the video is broken)
